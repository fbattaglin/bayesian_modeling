Bayesian Modeling &amp; Prediction

The project's goal is to create a model, based on Bayesian Statistics, to predict the audience score using data from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. The dataset contains information about movies in Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB. Both are considered review-aggregation websites for films. On IMDb, all films are given an overall rating out of ten. In a roundabout way, these ratings are derived from votes submitted by IMDb users, not movie critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives films a score out of 100 based on the averaged reviews of professional film critics.
